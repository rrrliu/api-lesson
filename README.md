# API Lesson Starter Code

## Introduction
An interactive demo where we visualize COVID-19 data! We'll be posting the recording when it becomes available.

## Setup:
1. Clone this repository from your terminal.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rrrliu/api-lesson.git
cd api-lesson
```
2. Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/ "Download Node.js") and [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/ "Download MongoDB")  installed.
3. Install all dependencies within the `client/` and `server/` folders with these in your terminal.
```bash
cd client/
npm install
cd ../server
npm install
cd ..
```
5. Follow along with the instructions in the demo!

## Solutions:
If you're stuck or lost, you can view the completed files on either the `solution-mongoDB` or `solution-mongoose` branch (they both do the same thing, just with a different framework).
